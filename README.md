# CNN-Example-Training-Using-Own-Dataset

Tired of training using MNIST. This tutorial is about training own dataset using Keras (Tensorflow backend)

The data set is obtained from Kaggle.com:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

There are 2 files in the repository:
1. createFolder.py for splitting the dataset into train, validation and test set.
2. dogs_cats_VGG19.py is the code for training model 

In this tutorial, we use VGG19 pretrained model to speed up the training process. 
VGG19 is a model pre-trained over imagenet

Happy Coding
